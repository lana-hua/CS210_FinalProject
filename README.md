# *Relationship Between Consumerism, Sustainability, and Global Warming*

This project aims to observe the sustainability of countries around the world
using datasets from Kaggle and our world dataset website. We will do this by focusing on the productino of Milk, Meat, Coffee, and overall Co2 emissions.
The model will help idenity which country needs to improve their preventative measures.
